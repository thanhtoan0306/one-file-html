"Develop a single, exhilarating HTML file that leverages CSS and Three.js to simulate an explosive nuclear fission chain reaction, delivering an interactive and visually stunning experience. The simulation should include:
Multiple Nuclei and Explosive Chain Reaction
Eight Uranium-235 nuclei in total, each depicted as a large, pulsating sphere containing 92 protons (vibrant red) and 143 neutrons (deep blue), randomly distributed within their spherical boundaries.
Position these nuclei at varied 3D locations in the scene to maximize reaction potential.
As each nucleus undergoes fission, release multiple neutrons to trigger a rapid, cascading chain reaction across all remaining nuclei, ensuring a spectacular sequence of events.
Initial Nucleus Behavior
Display all Uranium-235 nuclei with a subtle cyan glow and dynamic wobbling motion to emphasize their unstable, energetic state.
Enhance visual appeal with slight rotation for a lively, organic feel.
Fission Trigger
Introduce a single incoming neutron (metallic gray sphere) that initiates the chain reaction by accelerating toward the central nucleus from a distance.
Add a trailing effect to the neutron for a dramatic approach, amplifying anticipation.
Fission Process
Upon collision, the targeted nucleus splits into two glowing, pulsating fragments (e.g., Barium-141 and Krypton-92), each a vivid yellow with a mix of protons and neutrons.
Fragments separate with a burst of energy, visualized through:
An expanding, fading yellow shockwave.
A dense spray of 100 glowing orange particles for a fiery explosion effect.
Release 4 neutrons per fission, scattering outward at high speed to maximize chain reaction potential.
Chain Reaction
Neutrons from each fission event collide with any of the remaining seven nuclei, triggering additional fissions with a larger collision radius for frequent reactions.
Achieve a near-continuous cascade of splits until all nuclei are consumed, creating a thrilling domino effect.
Visual Effects
Use a dark, cosmic background (crafted in CSS) with a rich purple-to-black gradient.
Include 300 twinkling stars with a subtle animation for a mesmerizing, space-like ambiance.
Implement dynamic lighting with a bright central point light to cast dramatic shadows and highlight fission events.
Add vibrant emissive properties to protons, neutrons, and fragments for a glowing, radiant appearance.
Animation & Interactivity
Drive smooth, physics-inspired motion for the incoming neutron (accelerating over time), fragment trajectories, and neutron scattering.
Rotate the entire scene at a brisk pace for an immersive 3D experience.
Enhance nuclei with faster wobbling and scaling effects for heightened energy.
Animate fragments to shrink slightly as they move, adding realism to energy dissipation.
Performance & Responsiveness
Optimize rendering with Three.js best practices (e.g., reused geometries, efficient material management, controlled particle counts).
Ensure smooth performance across screen sizes with responsive resizing, avoiding lag or layout issues.
Use the Three.js library via CDN, define the starry background and styling with CSS, and include concise comments explaining core mechanics.
The final result should be an awe-inspiring, educational simulation of nuclear fission, showcasing a single neutron igniting a breathtaking chain reaction across eight Uranium-235 nuclei, with enhanced visuals like shockwaves, glowing trails, and dense particle bursts making it a captivating spectacle."
